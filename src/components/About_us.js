        SIT ACM Student Chapter is a community of computer science enthusiasts established in 2022. We are dedicated to providing educational and professional development opportunities to members while encouraging co-curricular activities for their overall growth. As an auxiliary organization of the ACM, we aspire to advance computer science as a science and a profession.
We organize a variety of events, such as workshops, hackathons, coding competitions, and guest lectures, to keep our members updated with the latest developments in computer science. Our goal is to build a strong community of computer science students who can collaborate and learn from each other.
